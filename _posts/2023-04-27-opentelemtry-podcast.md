title: Listen to me on the Day 2 Cloud podcast
excerpt: I was invited to chat with the Packet Pushers folk on 'OpenTelemetry â€“ Getting From Visibility To Observability With Ben Hall'. Looks like I pushed a show that's typically around 40 minutes long, over an hour for my guest appearance. Hope it's a good listen and you learn something new, audience!

I was recently invited to be a guest on the Day 2 Cloud podcast (part of the Packet Pushers network), that covers DevOps and cloud-ops topics. The conversation was quite engaging, and although the episodes typically run for 40 minutes, we managed to fill an entire hour!

In the podcast, we discussed OpenTelemetry and observability, which are not only areas of personal interest but should absolutely be something we are looking at for our long-term tech strategies. For those of you who have already heard me discuss these topics, I think this podcast presents a more dynamic and in-depth exploration.
