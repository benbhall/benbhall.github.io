So very happy to have received my certificate for CodeProject MVP 2019&nbsp;[MVA Most Valuable Author Award](https://www.codeproject.com/Competitions/1071/CodeProject-MVP-2019.aspx)

  <p>
    We recognize and value your exceptional contributions and commitment to the technical communities worldwide. By sharing your real world expertise and technical skills, you demonstrate outstanding technical community leadership.
  </p>
</blockquote>

It means a great deal to get this sort of recognition. 

I try really hard to take complex topics and make them relatively pain-free for busy developers.
