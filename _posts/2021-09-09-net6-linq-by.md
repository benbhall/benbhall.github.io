## LINQ Methods with the pattern *By

In the APIs for `System.Linq.Enumerable` and `System.Linq.Queryable` we already have overloads for:

- Distinct
- Execept
- Intersect
- Union
- Min
- Max

.NET 6 is adding *By counterparts that are easier to use with complex objects:

- DistinctBy
- ExeceptBy
- IntersectBy
- UnionBy
- MinBy
- MaxBy

### Taking Max as an Example

Where before, given some simple `List<Person>`, and we wanted to find the age of oldest Person, we might do:

```csharp
var maxAge = list.Max(x => x.Age);
```

But what if we wanted the whole object? Then we write slightly more complicated code:

```csharp
var oldestPerson = personList.OrderByDescending(x => x.Age).First();
```

In .NET 6 LINQ API, this is tidied up, and we can get the *whole* oldest Person object from our example, by supplying a key selector:

```csharp
var oldestPerson = personList.MaxBy(x => x.Age);
```
